# Website Templates
A base template for professor and student websites. It's goal is to create a unified look and feel for professor's class websites, which tend to be unattractive, unintuitively organized, and vary widely from class to class. 

The intent is to use HTML and CSS to put together a light website that meets professors needs. It has the potential to expand to a template for student portfolios.
