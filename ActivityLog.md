<h1> Design Challenges</h1>

<h2> Website Template vs Framework</h2>

<h3>What is a Website Template? </h3>
<p>A Website Template is a shell of a website where if downloaded, all you would have to change is the text and pictures to your liking. It is most similar to a Wordpress Theme that you can download and the pre-styled look of the website is prepared for you.</p>

<h3> What is a Framework? </h3>
<p>A Framework is more like a set of legos that have many components coded up but requires someone to piece them together to create a website in addition to filing in the shell of the website with data.</p>

<p> Each choice has their individual problems when it comes to this situation but in terms of ease of use, it seems like Website template is the best option.</p>

<h2> Why don't they just use Canvas? </h2>
<p> Who knows. The difference between this website template and canvas is that it will be fully responsive and lite, using only HTML and CSS. There won't be any javascript or server-side programming (besides the website server) involved so it should perform very well in low quailty internet environments.</p>
