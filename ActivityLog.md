<h1> Design Challenges</h1>

<h2> Website Template vs Framework</h2>

<h3>What is a Website Template? </h3>

<p>A Website Template is a shell of a website where if downloaded, all you would have to change is the text and pictures to your liking. It is most similar to a Wordpress Theme that you can download and the pre-styled look of the website is prepared for you.</p>

<h3> What is a Framework? </h3>
<p>A Framework is more like a set of legos that have many components coded up but requires someone to piece them together to create a website in addition to filing in the shell of the website with data.</p>

<p> Each choice has their individual problems when it comes to this situation but in terms of ease of use, it seems like Website template is the best option.</p>
